# FadingCircles
Create an expanding circle with each click that will fade out of existence over a short time.


# To Run
Simply download all the files of this repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

Left click to create a new circle that will begin to expand and fade immediately.
Once the circle has faded completely, the object is then deleted to prevent a slowdown of the program.
